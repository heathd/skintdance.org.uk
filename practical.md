# Practical Information

## Accommodation
		
'Indoor camping' means sleeping bags and mattresses on the floor in the hall. You'll need to bring a sleeping bag, mat and pillow. If you can't get hold of these, let us know, we might be able to help. Ear plugs are also a good idea, as music and chatter travels!

## Camping

For the hardy among you, there is a campsite close to the hall. 
£5/unit (tent or caravan) per night. Payment will be collected on arrival, but please tick the relevant box on the booking form, so we have a good estimate of numbers.
	
There are also B&Bs and self-catering cottages nearby.

## Showers
We will have access to the showers in the Sports Pavilion next door at certain times on Saturday and Sunday. The showers are coin-operated with 20p pieces. Please bring some with you!
		
## Food
Included meals are from Friday evening until Sunday lunchtime. Meals are vegetarian. Other diets, e.g. vegan, gluten-free, can be catered for. Let us know when you sign up.
		
Please bring your own drinks - water, juice, tea and coffee will be provided.

If you have a ticket with no meals provided, you may bring your own food and eat in the hall but you will not be able to use the kitchen for preparing it, due to space constraints. There are also 3 pubs in the village.
