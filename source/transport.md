## Station pick-ups

We will be organising a shuttle from Kelstedge to Ashover Parish Hall on Friday evening and in the opposite direction on Sunday afternoon. Please [contact us](mailto:skint.dance@gmail.com) with information about your arrival time so we can coordinate this. There will be a small charge for this service to cover fuel costs. 

## Car parking

There is plenty of parking next to the venue.

## Fare pool

The aim of a fare pool is to even out the transport costs of participants. People who have lower travel costs contribute a little more, and those with higher travel costs a bit less, in order that overall participation costs become more equal. If you are interested in taking part in this, or have questions, please contact us at [skint.dance@gmail.com](mailto:skint.dance@gmail.com) and youâ€™ll hear back from us with more details.
